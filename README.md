Command to run the code from Unix:

"julia main.jl (input1) (input2)"

(input1) = value of v_k

(input2) = value of tau

Example:

julia main.jl 20 3

NOTE:

In the programming of main.jl,

(input1) corresponds to "parse(Float64,ARGS[1])"

(input2) corresponds to "parse(Float64,ARGS[2])"

You might change the above parts for easier command input at you wish

All intermediary outputs for debugging (e.g. outputs of WeightFactor) has been REMOVED.
